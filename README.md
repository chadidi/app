# Personal Laravel 5.6 Boilerplate

Sometimes I get ideas and I'd like to start prototyping mockups fast. I really like using Bootstrap UI for that. I also like the ability that php has to include files and finally I like Laravel ability to include views from routes. 

Rather than starting from completly scratch, start from this which has already used components.

If I don't need heroku, just revert the commit of the heroku config. 

Enjoy !
